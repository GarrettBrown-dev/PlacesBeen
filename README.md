# _Places Been_

#### _C# ASP.NET MCV Project for Epicodus, September 30th, 2020_

#### By _**Mike Manchee, Ben Stoller, Natalie Murphy, and Garrett D Brown**_

## Description

A website where you can enter places you've been to create an online travel diary.

<!-- Brainstorming
A Place should be an object. Begin by giving it the property cityName.

After testing all back-end logic and developing an MVC front-end for this application, expand your Place model to include relevant properties like picture(s), how long you stayed, whom you travelled with, a journal entry, and so on. Integrate these into your front-end MVC application.

At the very least, the front end MVC web application should support RESTful Index, New, Create, and Show routes.
